<p align="center">This segment is where I publish my works.<br>
    Will work with infrared because
    I think it is an interesting,
    niche way of viewing the world.<br>
    You will see pictures of the moon and mountains frequently.<br>
    Street Photography is great.</p>

    <p align="center">The way I got into <i><b>photography</b></i> was finding out my parents had cameras to begin with.<br>
    I love the artform photography has, as well as the memories it can capture.<br>
    I now have a small collection of digital cameras.
