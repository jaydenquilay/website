This project will be a learning process.

I am trying to make a website without prior knowledge and see where I end up in.

This website will be for my finished works with photography.

Expect many edits to happen as I go.

Roadmap:

- ~~Add a box on the right side of the website for the directory, instead of using buttons.~~ Temporarily on the top, but I might consider it to be the final cut.
- CSS work.
- Javascript for the backend.
- Add images (Portrait, Photography photos, all that is necessary).
